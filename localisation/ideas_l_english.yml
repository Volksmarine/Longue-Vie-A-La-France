 under_the_russian_boot_desc:0 "When the Russian bear awoke to protect Mongolia from the invasion of the Zhang Empire, many were grateful. However good fortune has quickly turned sour. The Tsar has begun to exert a great deal of influence over the country, pulling Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren further and further closer to the interests of the Russians rather than the interests of Mongolians. This has resulted in the Bogd Khan being seen as weak and an enemy of the greater interests of the state. If the chains binding Mongolia to Russia aren't broken soon, many Mongols fear that the government and economy will be completely turned over to Russian control, essentially turning the once proud people into subjects of the Tsar in St. Petersburg."
 legacy_of_the_great_khan:0 "Legacy of the Great Khan"
 legacy_of_the_great_khan_desc:0 "The legacy set by the great Genghis Khan and his successors still stands as a shining beacon to all Mongolians to this day. The military and government rally behind the memory of the vast swaths of land their empire once ruled, remembering fondly the Mongol Horde of which the thundering of hooves had struck fear into the hearts of millions from Beijing to Warsaw. The Mongol people will always attempt to rise to the example set by their fearless Great Khan, even if that means sacrificing themselves in the process."

 blood_for_the_sky_god_desc:0 "The great Tengri demands the spilt blood of the Chinese. Those who have slaughtered, enslaved, impoverished, and beaten the proud Mongol people will no longer escape their fate. Only when the entirety of China is ruled from Ulaanbaatar will peace upon the earth be achieved, and Tengri's lust for blood will be wholly satisfied."

 catalan_autonomy:0 "Catalan Autonomy"
 catalan_autonomy_desc:0 "As the situation in Catalonia is far from stable, we must plot our course carefully. While expansionist elements in our government are opting for full integration and the stationing of our troops within the region, critics are concerned this could raise tensions and prompt resistance. We must thoroughly evaluate this situation and act prudently."
 political_divisions:0 "Political Divisions"
 political_divisions_desc:0 "Despite the hold that the Conservatives have maintained on our government, left-wing elements are gaining traction. Workers are unhappy with the policies implemented by the right-wing government, and strikes are not unusual. As more left-wing representatives are coming into power, some sort of solution must be devised, else our industry and government be crippled by division."

 triumph_in_europe_desc:0 "The brave soldiers of France fought and won one of the bloodiest conflicts in history, and our nation has emerged as the dominant power in Europe as a result of their sacrifice. While some nations may challenge our authority and policy, the French people can rest assured that if a conflict arises, we will win it, much as we won the Great War."
