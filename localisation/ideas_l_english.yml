 under_the_russian_boot_desc:0 "When the Russian bear awoke to protect Mongolia from the invasion of the Zhang Empire, many were grateful. However good fortune has quickly turned sour. The Tsar has begun to exert a great deal of influence over the country, pulling Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren further and further closer to the interests of the Russians rather than the interests of Mongolians. This has resulted in the Bogd Khan being seen as weak and an enemy of the greater interests of the state. If the chains binding Mongolia to Russia aren't broken soon, many Mongols fear that the government and economy will be completely turned over to Russian control, essentially turning the once proud people into subjects of the Tsar in St. Petersburg."

 legacy_of_the_great_khan_desc:0 "The legacy set by the great Genghis Khan and his successors still stands as a shining beacon to all Mongolians to this day. The military and government rally behind the memory of the vast swaths of land their empire once ruled, remembering fondly the Mongol Horde of which the thundering of hooves had struck fear into the hearts of millions from Beijing to Warsaw. The Mongol people will always attempt to rise to the example set by their fearless Great Khan, even if that means sacrificing themselves in the process."

 blood_for_the_sky_god_desc:0 "The great Tengri demands the spilt blood of the Chinese. Those who have slaughtered, enslaved, impoverished, and beaten the proud Mongol people will no longer escape their fate. Only when the entirety of China is ruled from Ulaanbaatar will peace upon the earth be achieved, and Tengri's lust for blood will be wholly satisfied."
